# Prototype development of game AI using neural network

I am a beginner. Development of game AI.
Because we started development in April 2017.
In this repository, development is proceeding with personal interest.

I am developing game AI using python.
Because I want to use a tensor flow framework.
However, it will be implemented even outside Python.
In the end, I am planning to rewrite it simply in a programming language (eg C ++) that has affinity with the game.

For this purpose, we are trying to develop a prototype by Python.

Again, I am a beginner.
And, there are few samples of the game AI program,
Therefore, if you have an expert, I would like to ask for your help at any time.

As an initial goal,
We are trying to realize a simple simulation game using "state driven machine", "behavior tree", "neural network" on the console.

Currently, each sample program has already been developed.
So we will show how to run the sample.

How to run

State driven machine

Behavior tree

Reinforcement learning


Task
· Global state transition bug (behavior tree)
· Reinforcement learning, how to incorporate neural network
