## Effect
I am a beginner developer of game AI,  
because we started development in April 2017. :)  
In this repository, development is proceeding with personal interest.  

I am developing game AI using python,  
because I want to use a tensor flow framework.  
However, it will be implemented even outside Python.  
In the end, I am planning to rewrite it simply in a programming language (eg C ++) that has affinity with the game.  

For this purpose, we are trying to develop a prototype by Python.  

Again, I am a beginner,  
and there are few samples of the game AI program.  
Therefore, if you have an expert, I would like to ask for your help at any time. :)  

As an initial goal,  
I'm trying to realize a simple simulation game using "FSM : FiniteStateMachine", "BehaviorTree", "RL :ReinforcementLearning" on the console.  

Currently, each sample program has already been developed.  
So we will show how to run the sample.  

## How to run sample programs

* *FSM*  
`$ cd sample/FSM`  
`$ python3 ~~~~`  

* *BehaviorTree*  
`$ cd sample/BehaviorTree`  
`$ python3 SampleEnemy.py `

* *ReinforcementLearning* 
`$ cd sample/ReinforcementLearning`  
`$ python3 ~~~~`

## MyTask
* Global state transition bug (behavior tree)  
* Reinforcement learning, how to incorporate neural network
